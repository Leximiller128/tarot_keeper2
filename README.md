## [Description](#table-of-contents)
This application would allow users to save their Tarot readings When they create an account so that they can come back to it without the long thinking proccess of that aha moment, when this application can save that for you including images, Decription and other information about that specific card.

Tarot card users have no way of keeping track of cards from readings the past in order to review or reflect. This app keeps track of cards you pulled in past readings, the date they were pulled and notes associated with them.

your readings are there for you at a press of a sign in or a sign up but your friends readings are also very much viewable once an account has been created and users have been added to you.

### User Story

```
User can add the Tarot cards from a reading to a list. All 50+ cards will be available to pick from in either a search bar or drop down tab. 

User will be able to add up to 8 cards per reading and will maintain the order theyâ€™re pulled in. User will have the ability to flip the cards or check a box if they are reversed. The user will be able to save the date the cards were pulled. User will be able to save a title for the pull, the initial question behind the card pull and any additional notes. 

User will need to sign up for access to the app and login to view. User will be able to add friends and see friends tarot readings. Favorite readings can be stared at the top, private or personal readings the user does not want shared can be kept private by checking a box. Readings will be saved in list style by date and title in chronological order with newest at the top. User will be able to search their past readings but the date or title. User will be able to view friends public readings also.
